This folder contains data for the formative assessment.
It contains data on participants accelerometer data and body measurment data.

There were 7456 accelerometer files in the original zipped file
They all look to have 8 columns with the same data in them.
The first row of the data contains the ID of the participant.
There are some rows with NA data that will need to be excluded.
Each file is named using the participant ID.

There is one BMX file with one row per participant (SEQN is the ID var) 
This has 28 columns and 9951 rows.
This file looks clean and ready to use to me.
